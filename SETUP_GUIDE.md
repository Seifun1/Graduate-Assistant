## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (latest stable version)
- Dart SDK (comes with Flutter)
- Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter extensions
- Supabase account

### 2. Supabase Setup

#### Step 1: Create Supabase Project
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Note down your project URL and anon key

#### Step 2: Database Setup
1. Go to the SQL Editor in your Supabase dashboard
2. Copy and paste the contents of `database_schema.sql`
3. Run the SQL script to create all tables, functions, and policies

#### Step 3: Storage Setup
The SQL script automatically creates storage buckets:
- `profiles` - for profile images

```bash
flutter pub get
```

#### Step 2: Configure Supabase
1. Open `lib/services/supabase_service.dart`
2. Replace the placeholder values:
```dart
await Supabase.initialize(
  url: 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL', // Replace with your project URL
  anonKey: 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY', // Replace with your anon key
);
```

#### Step 3: Run the App
```bash
flutter run
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables (Optional)
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### Android Configuration
Add internet permission in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

### iOS Configuration
Add permissions in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:
```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs access to camera to take profile pictures</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs access to photo library to select profile pictures</string>
```
